I am pursuing MS in Computer Engineering from Purdue. I am working with [Prof. Yung Hsian Lu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/HELPS/Faculty/yunglu.html), [Dr. Ebert](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ebertd/) and [Dr. Edward Delp](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ace/) on my thesis on finding the confidence level of camera. We are working on huge database of Traffic camera, where we are collecting the images from all around the world. My Thesis is to create a model and identify parameters to find confidence level of a given camera.

My interest in ML started when I was in my last company (Sanctum Networks in India). We were collecting lot of network traffic data for Liberty Global using NETCONF protocol. I was responsible for architecting and coding scalable client and servers for collecting data. I leveraged Apache Storm and Kafka to scale it.
Since the code has to be in C/C++, I created [Storm wrapper](https://github.com/anieshchawla/StormWrapperCpp) for C++ and shared with the community on [github](https://github.com/anieshchawla/StormWrapperCpp).

I have also worked in American Express for 2 years after my graduation from IIT Delhi. But I failed to realise the potential of data mining and data science at that time and shifted my career to my previous technical field at IIT Delhi in computer networks.

But I realised that unless we can visualise that data or find insights into it we will not be able to progress further. I started reading online, but I decided that it is much better to do a formal Education.

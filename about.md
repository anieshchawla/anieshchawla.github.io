I am pursuing MS in Computer Engineering from Purdue. I am working with [Prof. Yung Hsian Lu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/HELPS/Faculty/yunglu.html) and [Dr. Ebert](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ebertd/).

My interest in ML started when I was in my last company (Sanctum Networks in India). We were collecting lot of network traffic data for Liberty Global by using NETCONF protocol. I was responsible for architecting and coding scalable client and servers for collecting data. I leveraged Apache Storm and Kafka to scale it.
Since the code has to be in C/C++, I created [Storm wrapper](https://github.com/anieshchawla/StormWrapperCpp) for C++ and shared with the community.

But I realised that unless we can visualise that data or find insights into it we will not be able to progress further. I started reading online, but I realised that it is much better to do a formal Education.
